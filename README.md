# ebay-asmund
<p>Welcome. This is my take on eBay's API using eBaySDK module, this makes it easier for other developers to understand the API, although it is very well documented here https://github.com/timotheus/ebaysdk-python, also I will explain how to use calls that are not documented on that page aswell.
  
 We're only gonna be using the trading API, but I may in the future document others such as finding API and merchandising API.
 I will also implement extracting the order data to an Excel file aswell as being able to automate the process of sending digital goods to the buyer automatically and marking the item as shipped.
 </p>

# ebay-asmund
Welcome. This is my take on eBay's API using eBaySDK module, this makes it easier for other developers to understand the API, although it is very well documented here https://github.com/timotheus/ebaysdk-python, also I will explain how to use calls that are not documented on that page aswell.
